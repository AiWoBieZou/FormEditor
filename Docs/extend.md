# Creating your own custom field
So you find yourself lacking some special field for your project? No problem! Form Editor is super easy to extend with new field types. You can choose two ways to do this:

1. [The simple way](extend_field_simple.md) - by configuration. No coding required. Choose this if you're not a .NET developer, or if you just don't need any custom configuration and validation of your field (mandatory validation is supported out of the box).
2. [The advanced way](extend_field_advanced.md) - by coding. Choose this if the statement above doesn't suit you :)

## Field icon
No matter which of the above you choose, you'll need a field icon. It has to be a 16x16 px PNG and it should be grayscale.

If you want your field icon to have the same look and feel as the ones shipped with Form Editor, head on over to http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/, pick an icon from the Fugue Icons set and make it grayscale. 

## Next step
Onwards to [creating a simple custom field](extend_field_simple.md) or  [creating an advanced custom field](extend_field_advanced.md).
