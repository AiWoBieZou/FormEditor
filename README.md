# Form Editor for Umbraco

Form Editor is a package for [Umbraco](http://umbraco.com/) 7.3+ that lets the editors create forms and manage form submissions as just another part of the Umbraco content.

Some highlights include:
* Grid based form editing.
* Ships with (almost) all HTML5 input types.
* Cross field validation.
* Full control over the frontend rendering.
* Full support for asynchronous postback, e.g. for AngularJS.
* Easily extendable with custom fields.
* Editors can add texts and images alongside the form fields.
* reCAPTCHA support.
* Fully localizable.
